# Python Implementation

This is the preliminary version of the orbital propagator. To get started, install the package manager + virtual environment manager I'm using if you don't already have pipenv:

```
python3 -m pip install pipenv
```

To install all of the packages, navigate to this directory (`./python/`) and run:

```
python3 -m pipenv install
```

To run, enter the virtual environment and execute a demo script of your own:

```
python3 -m  pipenv shell

python3 demo.py
```
